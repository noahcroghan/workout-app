# Deprecation Status

- I am no longer interested in updating this project. The Expo SDK updates far too frequently with no long-term support (they even recommend using development builds for production apps).
- As it stands, this is a non-production app that is fully feature complete.
- Major vulnerabilities should have no effect as this app is just for demonstration purposes.

# Workout App

- Simplistic mobile app for core lifts; deadlift, backsquat, and bench press
- Generate a workout by entering your one rep max and number of sets desired
- Complete the workout and the app will store your completed workout.
- Press on a completed workout if you would like to delete it from history.

# Instructions

Go to https://snack.expo.dev/@nc759743/workout-app?platform=android to see a demo of the app on a virtual machine.

Optionally, if you prefer to develop locally, you can instead clone this Git repository, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and run the app with `npx expo start`, which supports opening the app in a local [Android virtual machine](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/), or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (note that iOS is not supported due to not using the latest Expo SDK).
